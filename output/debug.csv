                                              Maybe the issue is because when the country picker sheet closes, the phone number text field may automatically regain focus(?).

                                              1. Use fg/secondary fpr placeholder text

                                              *Prerequisites*:
                                              user has an account with old formatted phone number

                                              *Steps*:

                                              # Login to account, choose market with delivery (i.e. Malaysia)
                                              # Proceed to Delivery order
                                              # Add delivery address, add any product to cart → proceed to Confirm&Pay screen
                                              # See error related to incorrect phone number format → tap on phone number field
                                              # Enter valid country code and phone number (i.e. Country code = Austria (+43),Phone number = 680001122)
                                              # Checkbox can be selected or unselected → click [Save]
                                              # Click [Place order and pay] → get payment error
                                              # User can see phone number in the field → tap on phone number field → see 'Phone number' screen

                                              *Expected*: phone number should be the same as user entered before payment and what user can see in Confirm&Pay screen

                                              *Actual*: country code is set to +44, phone number is empty. When user closes ‘Phone number' screen, it’s still possible to see phone number on Confirm&Pay view

                                              # Go back to cart/menu screen

Retry button will not enable, and user needs to move manually reload the screen to activate the timer again.

At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              The GMAL product team wants to elaborate on the Support Information View and consolidate it to become the one place for markets to put all of their Feedback, Support, FAQ and contact us links into on place. At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              As a user I would like to be able to report an issue with the app by going to the Support Information View, click on the “Report an Issue” button and being taken through the flow in order to send an email directly to my market’s helpdesk with all details added.

                                              * Report an Issue button needs to copy the information on the Support Information View and copied to the actual email
                                              * Based on the user selected answer to which Problem they are seeing - this also needs to be copied to the actual email
                                              * User should be able to add attachment to the email

                                              The GMAL product team wants to elaborate on the Support Information View and consolidate it to become the one place for markets to put all of their Feedback, Support, FAQ and contact us links into on place. At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              The GMAL product team wants to elaborate on the Support Information View and consolidate it to become the one place for markets to put all of their Feedback, Support, FAQ and contact us links into on place. At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              The GMAL product team wants to elaborate on the Support Information View and consolidate it to become the one place for markets to put all of their Feedback, Support, FAQ and contact us links into on place. At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              The GMAL product team wants to elaborate on the Support Information View and consolidate it to become the one place for markets to put all of their Feedback, Support, FAQ and contact us links into on place. At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              The GMAL product team wants to elaborate on the Support Information View and consolidate it to become the one place for markets to put all of their Feedback, Support, FAQ and contact us links into on place. At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              The GMAL product team wants to elaborate on the Support Information View and consolidate it to become the one place for markets to put all of their Feedback, Support, FAQ and contact us links into on place. At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              The GMAL product team wants to elaborate on the Support Information View and consolidate it to become the one place for markets to put all of their Feedback, Support, FAQ and contact us links into one place. At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              h2. User Story:

                                              As a user I would like to be able to report an issue with the app by going to the Support Information View, click on the “Report an Issue” button and being taken through the flow in order to send an email directly to my market’s helpdesk with all details added.

                                              h2. Condition of Satisfaction:

                                              * Report an Issue button needs to copy the information on the Support Information View and then copied to the actual email body
                                              * Based on the user selected answer to which Issue from the Category list they are seeing - this also needs to be copied to the actual email subject
                                              * User should be able to add attachment to the email
                                              * Copy Information button to be moved to the bottom
                                              * Deeplink to be added to The 'Help and support' screen*/Report an Issue (MEDS)*
                                              * *Report an issue new screen* - needs to be implemented with Phrase keys and either remote config or KMP logic
                                              * stakeholders to decide if we update the “menu_sub” and “{{supportInfo_marketSupport}}"" for the markets, or let them add it by choice themselves

                                              h2. requirements:

                                              *  on the “technical details” screen, remove the “technical details title”
                                              * on the “technical details” screen, move the “copy” button to the bottom of the page
                                              * on the “report an issue” screen, we should show the following sections, depending on what is supported for that market:

                                              The GMAL product team wants to elaborate on the Support Information View and consolidate it to become the one place for markets to put all of their Feedback, Support, FAQ and contact us links into one place. At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              h2. User Story:

                                              As a user I would like to be able to report an issue with the app by going to the Support Information View, click on the “Report an Issue” button and being taken through the flow in order to send an email directly to my market’s helpdesk with all details added.

                                              h2. Condition of Satisfaction:

                                              * Report an Issue button needs to copy the information on the Support Information View and then copied to the actual email body
                                              * Based on the user selected answer to which Issue from the Category list they are seeing - this also needs to be copied to the actual email subject
                                              * User should be able to add attachment to the email
                                              * Copy Information button to be moved to the bottom
                                              * Deeplink to be added to The 'Help and support' screen*/Report an Issue (MEDS)*
                                              * *Report an issue new screen* - needs to be implemented with Phrase keys and either remote config or KMP logic
                                              * stakeholders to decide if we update the “menu_sub” and “{{supportInfo_marketSupport}}"" for the markets, or let them add it by choice themselves

                                              The GMAL product team wants to elaborate on the Support Information View and consolidate it to become the one place for markets to put all of their Feedback, Support, FAQ and contact us links into one place. At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              h2. User Story:

                                              As a user I would like to be able to report an issue with the app by going to the Support Information View, click on the “Report an Issue” button and being taken through the flow in order to send an email directly to my market’s helpdesk with all details added.

                                              * Report an Issue button needs to copy the information on the Support Information View and then copied to the actual email body
                                              * Based on the user selected answer to which Issue from the Category list they are seeing - this also needs to be copied to the actual email subject
                                              * User should be able to add attachment to the email
                                              * Copy Information button to be moved to the bottom
                                              * Deeplink to be added to The 'Help and support' screen*/Report an Issue (MEDS)*

                                              The GMAL product team wants to elaborate on the Support Information View and consolidate it to become the one place for markets to put all of their Feedback, Support, FAQ and contact us links into one place. At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              h2. User Story:

                                              As a user I would like to be able to report an issue with the app by going to the Support Information View, click on the “Report an Issue” button and being taken through the flow in order to send an email directly to my market’s helpdesk with all details added.

                                              h2. Condition of Satisfaction:

                                              * Report an Issue button needs to copy the information on the Support Information View and then copied to the actual email body
                                              * Based on the user selected answer to which Issue from the Category list they are seeing - this also needs to be copied to the actual email subject
                                              * User should be able to add attachment to the email
                                              * Copy Information button to be moved to the bottom
                                              * Deeplink to be added to The 'Help and support' screen*/Report an Issue (MEDS)*
                                              * *Report an issue new screen* - needs to be implemented with Phrase keys and either remote config or KMP logic
                                              * stakeholders to decide if we update the “menu_sub” and “{{supportInfo_marketSupport}}"" for the markets, or let them add it by choice themselves

                                              h2. requirements:

                                              * if  “userReview_emailToSendFeedback” is null, we do not show the Report an issue.
                                              * if {{supportInfo_marketSupport}} has an item for report an issue we show it
                                              * on the “technical details” screen, remove the “technical details title”
                                              * on the “technical details” screen, move the “copy” button to the bottom of the page
                                              * on the “report an issue” screen, we should show the following sections, depending on what is supported for that market:
                                              ** account
                                              ** mobile order
                                              ** delivery

                                              * on the “report an issue” screen,  all sections, except for “deals & account” should be toggled on or off based on their respective remote config keys
                                              * on the “report an issue” screen, when we press the continue button,
                                              ** on android, we should deeplink to the users mail client through a “mailto:” deeplink, format: mailto:test?cc=ddd&bcc=dd&subject=ddd&body=dddd
                                              ** iOS TBD
                                              * on the “report an issue”, you can only select, “one” or “none” options
                                              * when composing an email
                                              ** the subject should be “issue report” + section + option
                                              ** if no section/option was selected, this is omitted
                                              ** the receiver is a in remote config configured market help email address
                                              ** the content, we add three headlines, “what happened”, “what did you expect”, “how can we help you”
                                              ** it should contain some text: “Send from my GMALite app Thank you for your feedback!”
                                              ** it should contain the technical details, in the same format as you would receive from the existing “copy” buttom.
                                              * add support of this route to the deeplink.kt file in KMP
                                              * add documentation of the new deeplink in confluence

                                              The GMAL product team wants to elaborate on the Support Information View and consolidate it to become the one place for markets to put all of their Feedback, Support, FAQ and contact us links into one place. At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              h2. User Story:

                                              As a user I would like to be able to report an issue with the app by going to the Support Information View, click on the “Report an Issue” button and being taken through the flow in order to send an email directly to my market’s helpdesk with all details added.

                                              h2. Condition of Satisfaction:

                                              * Report an Issue button needs to copy the information on the Support Information View and then copied to the actual email body
                                              * Based on the user selected answer to which Issue from the Category list they are seeing - this also needs to be copied to the actual email subject
                                              * User should be able to add attachment to the email
                                              * Copy Information button to be moved to the bottom
                                              * Deeplink to be added to The 'Help and support' screen*/Report an Issue (MEDS)*
                                              * *Report an issue new screen* - needs to be implemented with Phrase keys and either remote config or KMP logic

At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              The GMAL product team wants to elaborate on the Support Information View and consolidate it to become the one place for markets to put all of their Feedback, Support, FAQ and contact us links into one place. At the same time they want to add a button to “Report Issue” that would take information on the Support Information View and ask the user to answer one contextual question to be added to the email template that will be sent by the end user to the market’s helpdesk email.

                                              h2. User Story:

                                              As a user I would like to be able to report an issue with the app by going to the Support Information View, click on the “Report an Issue” button and being taken through the flow in order to send an email directly to my market’s helpdesk with all details added.

                                              h2. Condition of Satisfaction:

                                              * Report an Issue button needs to copy the information on the Support Information View and then copied to the actual email body
                                              * Based on the user selected answer to which Issue from the Category list they are seeing - this also needs to be copied to the actual email subject
                                              * User should be able to add attachment to the email
                                              * Copy Information button to be moved to the bottom
                                              * Deeplink to be added to The 'Help and support' screen*/Report an Issue (MEDS)*
                                              * *Report an issue new screen* - needs to be implemented with Phrase keys and either remote config or KMP logic
                                              * stakeholders to decide if we update the “menu_sub” and “{{supportInfo_marketSupport}}"" for the markets, or let them add it by choice themselves

                                              Instead of just a text field where the customer could enter any number, we introduced a properly formatted field type which allowed the customer to select their international dial code and if they entered a phone number with unnecessary preceding zeros, they would be removed as the phone number was validated based on the country code you selected.

                                              In the delivery ordering flow, a phone number is required. If the customer has a phone number in their account (Plexure) it will use that phone number. If that phone number has been formatted correctly (If the account was created after the [https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-27424|https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-27424|smart-link] change) then all is good. If the phone number is formatted incorrectly (was created before the change and so doesn’t have an international dial code) then there is a problem when it's sent to loginext.

                                              In order to get around this issue, the app is prefixing numbers with the international dial code, as set in remote config but its not removing any unnecessary preceding zeros, validating that its a correct format or checking the country code is correct. This is a problem because the rider cannot get in touch with the customer as it says the number is incorrect.

                                              We need to check that the number in the customer’s account is formatted correctly at the point they place an order. It should be compliant with the E164 standard format. If the phone number being used is the one from the customer’s account, and we present the screen to let them choose/confirm their country/dial code then this should update the number in the account too.

                                              Prefixing the number with a country code from remote config and sending this to loginext should then be stopped.

This is a problem because the rider cannot get in touch with the customer as it says the number is incorrect.

It should be compliant with the E164 standard format. If the phone number being used is the one from the customer’s account, and we present the screen to let them choose/confirm their country/dial code then this should update the number in the account too.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      In the delivery ordering flow, a phone number is required. If the customer has a phone number in their account (Plexure) it will use that phone number. If that phone number has been formatted correctly (If the account was created after the [https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-27424|https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-27424|smart-link] change) then all is good. If the phone number is formatted incorrectly (was created before the change and so doesn’t have an international dial code) then there is a problem when it's sent to loginext.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      In order to get around this issue, the app is prefixing numbers with the international dial code, as set in remote config but its not removing any unnecessary preceding zeros, validating that its a correct format or checking the country code is correct. This is a problem because the rider cannot get in touch with the customer as it says the number is incorrect.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We need to check that the number in the customer’s account is formatted correctly at the point they place an order. It should be compliant with the E164 standard format. If the phone number being used is the one from the customer’s account, and we present the screen to let them choose/confirm their country/dial code then this should update the number in the account too.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Prefixing the number with a country code from remote config and sending this to loginext should then be stopped.

                                              Instead of just a text field where the customer could enter any number, we introduced a properly formatted field type which allowed the customer to select their international dial code and if they entered a phone number with unnecessary preceding zeros, they would be removed as the phone number was validated based on the country code you selected.

                                              In the delivery ordering flow, a phone number is required. If the customer has a phone number in their account (Plexure) it will use that phone number. If that phone number has been formatted correctly (If the account was created after the [https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-27424|https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-27424|smart-link] change) then all is good. If the phone number is formatted incorrectly (was created before the change and so doesn’t have an international dial code) then there is a problem when it's sent to loginext.

                                              In order to get around this issue, the app is prefixing numbers with the international dial code, as set in remote config but its not removing any unnecessary preceding zeros, validating that its a correct format or checking the country code is correct. This is a problem because the rider cannot get in touch with the customer as it says the number is incorrect.

                                              We need to check that the number in the customer’s account is formatted correctly at the point they place an order. It should be compliant with the E164 standard format. If the phone number being used is the one from the customer’s account, and we present the screen to let them choose/confirm their country/dial code then this should update the number in the account too.

                                              Prefixing the number with a country code from remote config and sending this to loginext should then be stopped.

 461, "GMAL-31300", "description"           , "In [https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-27424|https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-27424|smart-link] we make some enhancements to the phone number field. Docs for this change are here: [https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GL/pages/661718224/How-To+Configure+Phone+Number+Field+Validation|https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GL/pages/661718224/How-To+Configure+Phone+Number+Field+Validation|smart-link]



                                              Instead of just a text field where the customer could enter any number, we introduced a properly formatted field type which allowed the customer to select their international dial code and if they entered a phone number with unnecessary preceding zeros, they would be removed as the phone number was validated based on the country code you selected.

                                              In the delivery ordering flow, a phone number is required. If the customer has a phone number in their account (Plexure) it will use that phone number. If that phone number has been formatted correctly (If the account was created after the [https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-27424|https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-27424|smart-link] change) then all is good. If the phone number is formatted incorrectly (was created before the change and so doesn’t have an international dial code) then there is a problem when it's sent to loginext.

                                              In order to get around this issue, the app is prefixing numbers with the international dial code, as set in remote config but its not removing any unnecessary preceding zeros, validating that its a correct format or checking the country code is correct. This is a problem because the rider cannot get in touch with the customer as it says the number is incorrect.

                                              We need to check that the number in the customer’s account is formatted correctly at the point they place an order. It should be compliant with the E164 standard format. If the phone number being used is the one from the customer’s account, and we present the screen to let them choose/confirm their country/dial code then this should update the number in the account too.

                                              Prefixing the number with a country code from remote config and sending this to loginext should then be stopped.

                                              *Requirments*

                                              * Change that it will trigger the formatting for existing phone number of user to E164

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Instead of just a text field where the customer could enter any number, we introduced a properly formatted field type which allowed the customer to select their international dial code and if they entered a phone number with unnecessary preceding zeros, they would be removed as the phone number was validated based on the country code you selected.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      In the delivery ordering flow, a phone number is required. If the customer has a phone number in their account (Plexure) it will use that phone number. If that phone number has been formatted correctly (If the account was created after the [https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-27424|https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-27424|smart-link] change) then all is good. If the phone number is formatted incorrectly (was created before the change and so doesn’t have an international dial code) then there is a problem when it's sent to loginext.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      In order to get around this issue, the app is prefixing numbers with the international dial code, as set in remote config but its not removing any unnecessary preceding zeros, validating that its a correct format or checking the country code is correct. This is a problem because the rider cannot get in touch with the customer as it says the number is incorrect.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We need to check that the number in the customer’s account is formatted correctly at the point they place an order. It should be compliant with the E164 standard format. If the phone number being used is the one from the customer’s account, and we present the screen to let them choose/confirm their country/dial code then this should update the number in the account too.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Prefixing the number with a country code from remote config and sending this to loginext should then be stopped.

                                              Instead of just a text field where the customer could enter any number, we introduced a properly formatted field type which allowed the customer to select their international dial code and if they entered a phone number with unnecessary preceding zeros, they would be removed as the phone number was validated based on the country code you selected.

                                              In the delivery ordering flow, a phone number is required. If the customer has a phone number in their account (Plexure) it will use that phone number.

If the phone number is formatted incorrectly (was created before the change and so doesn’t have an international dial code) then there is a problem when it's sent to loginext.

                                              In order to get around this issue, the app is prefixing numbers with the international dial code, as set in remote config but its not removing any unnecessary preceding zeros, validating that its a correct format or checking the country code is correct. This is a problem because the rider cannot get in touch with the customer as it says the number is incorrect.

                                              We need to check that the number in the customer’s account is formatted correctly at the point they place an order. It should be compliant with the E164 standard format. If the phone number being used is the one from the customer’s account, and we present the screen to let them choose/confirm their country/dial code then this should update the number in the account too.

                                              Prefixing the number with a country code from remote config and sending this to loginext should then be stopped.

                                              *Requirments*

                                              * Change that it will trigger the formatting for existing phone number of user to E164
                                              * If users phone number is not valid E164 format, promp user that the phone number need to be updated in confirm and pay screen
                                              * Change the confirmation about saving to your profile to be default on or change logic to ask if they wanna use phone number for temporarily
                                              * Remote config to possible not validate existing phone number as E164, default off.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We need to check that the number in the customer’s account is formatted correctly at the point they place an order. It should be compliant with the E164 standard format. If the phone number being used is the one from the customer’s account, and we present the screen to let them choose/confirm their country/dial code then this should update the number in the account too.

                                              In the delivery ordering flow, a phone number is required. If the customer has a phone number in their account (Plexure) it will use that phone number.

If the phone number is formatted incorrectly (was created before the change and so doesn’t have an international dial code) then there is a problem when it's sent to loginext.

                                              In order to get around this issue, the app is prefixing numbers with the international dial code, as set in remote config but its not removing any unnecessary preceding zeros, validating that its a correct format or checking the country code is correct. This is a problem because the rider cannot get in touch with the customer as it says the number is incorrect.

                                              We need to check that the number in the customer’s account is formatted correctly at the point they place an order. It should be compliant with the E164 standard format. If the phone number being used is the one from the customer’s account, and we present the screen to let them choose/confirm their country/dial code then this should update the number in the account too.

                                              Prefixing the number with a country code from remote config and sending this to loginext should then be stopped.

                                              * If users phone number is not valid E164 format, promp user that the phone number need to be updated in confirm and pay screen
                                              * Change the confirmation about saving to your profile to be default on or change logic to ask if they wanna use phone number for temporarily
                                              * Remote config to possible not validate existing phone number as E164, default off.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We need to check that the number in the customer’s account is formatted correctly at the point they place an order. It should be compliant with the E164 standard format. If the phone number being used is the one from the customer’s account, and we present the screen to let them choose/confirm their country/dial code then this should update the number in the account too.

This is to keep it simpler.

                                              * Design concept should feature:
                                              ** MVP Scope: User flow for “Report an issue” from the technical support page as described above.
                                              ** Extended: User flow for reporting an issue contextually from specific error screens or problem touchpoints.
                                              * To consider:
                                              ** Promise to customer: we should describe what the user should expect to happen when reporting an issue using an email.
                                              ** What is the issue? From the generic support page, it is not obvious what problem the user had (technical, points missing, payment methods, other). Can we make it clear to the user how they should describe the problem so that customer support will have a
                                              ** Integrating the mail composition in the app experience? The intended MVP solution is to use the email client on the user’s device to send an email. Depending on user’s choice of default client it should be possible to compose and send the email including attached information from within the app.(Similar to share sheets common in many apps).

                                              * Starting with the Support Information View and adding a ""Report Issue"" button to that that basically copies the information already available on that screen and trigger the native iOS and Android email clients for the user and allows the user to send the information into the Market's own helpdesk
                                              * Design concept should feature:
                                              ** MVP Scope: User flow for “Report an issue” from the technical support page as described above.
                                              ** Extended: User flow for reporting an issue contextually from specific error screens or problem touchpoints.
                                              * To consider:
                                              ** Promise to customer: we should describe what the user should expect to happen when reporting an issue using an email.
                                              ** What is the issue? From the generic support page, it is not obvious what problem the user had (technical, points missing, payment methods, other). Can we make it clear to the user how they should describe the problem so that customer support will have a
                                              ** Integrating the mail composition in the app experience? The intended MVP solution is to use the email client on the user’s device to send an email. Depending on user’s choice of default client it should be possible to compose and send the email including attached information from within the app.(Similar to share sheets common in many apps).

                                              ** MVP Scope: User flow for “Report an issue” from the technical support page as described above.
                                              ** Extended: User flow for reporting an issue contextually from specific error screens or problem touchpoints.
                                              * To consider:
                                              ** Promise to customer: we should describe what the user should expect to happen when reporting an issue using an email.
                                              ** What is the issue? From the generic support page, it is not obvious what problem the user had (technical, points missing, payment methods, other). Can we make it clear to the user how they should describe the problem so that customer support will have a
                                              ** Integrating the mail composition in the app experience? The intended MVP solution is to use the email client on the user’s device to send an email. Depending on user’s choice of default client it should be possible to compose and send the email including attached information from within the app.(Similar to share sheets common in many apps).

Cocoapods is still supported and is likely to to be supported for a while to come. But with SPM being the agreed upon tool, slightly faster build times and an overal easier developer experience it is in our best interest to migrate as soon as possible.

                                              We have implemented [https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-28016|https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-28016|smart-link]  in NETT view.
                                              However, NETT view is problematic when we want to show the value of delivery fee discount (with strike-off) customer is getting

                                              h2. *Requirements:*

                                              * In Confirm & Pay Screen, when GROSS view is configured, add the relevant taxes below
                                              ** {{order_sharedlibSettings_includeVATInOrderPriceDetails}}: When true, display prices in gross with applicable taxes (purple screen shot), when false, show net prices (green screen shot)? To be refined
                                              ** {{order_hideSummaryTaxes}}: Show or hide the taxes for Gross market only (This is not the behavior it has right now, right now on Gross markets it hides everything)

                                              As a business, I want to improve GROSS view to reflect relevant taxes in Confirm & Pay Screen  so that customer is aware of the taxes he is paying.

                                              h2. *Background:*

                                              We have implemented [https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-28016|https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-28016|smart-link]  in NETT view.
                                              However, NETT view is problematic when we want to show the value of delivery fee discount (with strike-off) customer is getting

                                              There has been configurations that controls if we show have VAT included in subtotal in the confirm and pay screen ({{order_sharedlibSettings_includeVATInOrderPriceDetails}}), however this config has been confusing ppl that we are controlling to show gross or net price in client side, which is not true.
                                              The option to include VAT in subtotal has also resulted in that we do not show anymore VAT in the screen and therefor the popularity of the VAT included subtotal has been low by market.

                                              There is also config {{order_hideSummaryTaxes}} which has been confusing what exactly it does and overlapped the function with {{order_sharedlibSettings_includeVATInOrderPriceDetails}}config. the {{order_hideSummaryTaxes}} are meant to hide anything other then just total price, however with different type of fee that can be showed, it is not really true anymore to just show the total price

                                              * Display gross or net shall applicable to both MOP & Delivery flow

                                              ** subtotal shall calculate VAT in to the price
                                              ** show the VAT as separate section with included annotation
                                              * When market choose to show price in NET way
                                              ** subtotal shall exclude VAT in the price
                                              ** show the VAT right below all fees and no indication that it is included
                                              * When market choose to not show any details of taxes
                                              ** subtotal shows only if there is Fee to be shown and includes VAT in the price
                                              ** VAT shall not be show

                                              As a business, I want to improve GROSS view to reflect relevant taxes in Confirm & Pay Screen  so that customer is aware of the taxes he is paying.

                                              h2. *Background:*

                                              We have implemented [https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-28016|https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-28016|smart-link]  in NETT view.
                                              However, NETT view is problematic when we want to show the value of delivery fee discount (with strike-off) customer is getting

                                              There has been configurations that controls if we show have VAT included in subtotal in the confirm and pay screen ({{order_sharedlibSettings_includeVATInOrderPriceDetails}}), however this config has been confusing ppl that we are controlling to show gross or net price in client side, which is not true.
                                              The option to include VAT in subtotal has also resulted in that we do not show anymore VAT in the screen and therefor the popularity of the VAT included subtotal has been low by market.

                                              There is also config {{order_hideSummaryTaxes}} which has been confusing what exactly it does and overlapped the function with {{order_sharedlibSettings_includeVATInOrderPriceDetails}}config. the {{order_hideSummaryTaxes}} are meant to hide anything other then just total price, however with different type of fee that can be showed, it is not really true anymore to just show the total price

                                              h2. *Requirements:*

                                              * Display gross or net shall applicable to both MOP & Delivery flow
                                              * When market choose to show price in GROSS way,
                                              ** subtotal shall calculate VAT in to the price
                                              ** show the VAT as separate section with included annotation
                                              * When market choose to show price in NET way
                                              ** subtotal shall exclude VAT in the price
                                              ** show the VAT right below all fees and no indication that it is included
                                              * When market choose to not show any details of taxes
                                              ** subtotal shows only if there is Fee to be shown and includes VAT in the price
                                              ** VAT shall not be show

                                              As a business, I want to improve GROSS view to reflect relevant taxes in Confirm & Pay Screen  so that customer is aware of the taxes he is paying.

                                              h2. *Background:*

                                              We have implemented [https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-28016|https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-28016|smart-link]  in NETT view.
                                              However, NETT view is problematic when we want to show the value of delivery fee discount (with strike-off) customer is getting

                                              There has been configurations that controls if we show have VAT included in subtotal in the confirm and pay screen ({{order_sharedlibSettings_includeVATInOrderPriceDetails}}), however this config has been confusing ppl that we are controlling to show gross or net price in client side, which is not true.
                                              The option to include VAT in subtotal has also resulted in that we do not show anymore VAT in the screen and therefor the popularity of the VAT included subtotal has been low by market.

                                              There is also config {{order_hideSummaryTaxes}} which has been confusing what exactly it does and overlapped the function with {{order_sharedlibSettings_includeVATInOrderPriceDetails}}config. the {{order_hideSummaryTaxes}} are meant to hide anything other then just total price, however with different type of fee that can be showed, it is not really true anymore to just show the total price

                                              h2. *Requirements:*

                                              * Display gross or net shall applicable to both MOP & Delivery flow
                                              * When market choose to show price in GROSS way,
                                              ** subtotal shall calculate VAT in to the price
                                              ** show the VAT as separate section with included annotation
                                              * When market choose to show price in NET way
                                              ** subtotal shall exclude VAT in the price
                                              ** show the VAT right below all fees and no indication that it is included
                                              * When market choose to not show any details of taxes
                                              ** subtotal shows only if there is Fee to be shown and includes VAT in the price
                                              ** VAT shall not be show

                                              As a business, I want to improve GROSS view to reflect relevant taxes in Confirm & Pay Screen  so that customer is aware of the taxes he is paying.

                                              h2. *Background:*

                                              We have implemented [https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-28016|https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-28016|smart-link]  in NETT view.
                                              However, NETT view is problematic when we want to show the value of delivery fee discount (with strike-off) customer is getting

                                              There has been configurations that controls if we show have VAT included in subtotal in the confirm and pay screen ({{order_sharedlibSettings_includeVATInOrderPriceDetails}}), however this config has been confusing ppl that we are controlling to show gross or net price in client side, which is not true.
                                              The option to include VAT in subtotal has also resulted in that we do not show anymore VAT in the screen and therefor the popularity of the VAT included subtotal has been low by market.

                                              There is also config {{order_hideSummaryTaxes}} which has been confusing what exactly it does and overlapped the function with {{order_sharedlibSettings_includeVATInOrderPriceDetails}}config. the {{order_hideSummaryTaxes}} are meant to hide anything other then just total price, however with different type of fee that can be showed, it is not really true anymore to just show the total price

                                              h2. *Requirements:*

                                              * Display gross or net shall be applicable to both MOP & Delivery flow
                                              * When market choose to show price in GROSS way,
                                              ** subtotal shall calculate VAT in to the price
                                              ** show the VAT as separate section with included annotation
                                              * When market choose to show price in NET way
                                              ** subtotal shall exclude VAT in the price
                                              ** show the VAT right below all fees and no indication that it is included
                                              * When market choose to not show any details of taxes

                                              As a business, I want to improve GROSS view to reflect relevant taxes in Confirm & Pay Screen  so that customer is aware of the taxes he is paying.

                                              h2. *Background:*

                                              We have implemented [https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-28016|https://mcd-tools.atlassian.net/browse/GMAL-28016|smart-link]  in NETT view.
                                              However, NETT view is problematic when we want to show the value of delivery fee discount (with strike-off) customer is getting

                                              There has been configurations that controls if we show have VAT included in subtotal in the confirm and pay screen ({{order_sharedlibSettings_includeVATInOrderPriceDetails}}), however this config has been confusing ppl that we are controlling to show gross or net price in client side, which is not true.
                                              The option to include VAT in subtotal has also resulted in that we do not show anymore VAT in the screen and therefor the popularity of the VAT included subtotal has been low by market.

                                              There is also config {{order_hideSummaryTaxes}} which has been confusing what exactly it does and overlapped the function with {{order_sharedlibSettings_includeVATInOrderPriceDetails}}config. the {{order_hideSummaryTaxes}} are meant to hide anything other then just total price, however with different type of fee that can be showed, it is not really true anymore to just show the total price

                                              h2. *Requirements:*

                                              * Display gross or net shall be applicable to both MOP & Delivery flow
                                              * When market choose to show price in GROSS way,
                                              ** subtotal shall calculate VAT in to the price
                                              ** show the VAT as separate section with included annotation
                                              * When market choose to show price in NET way
                                              ** subtotal shall exclude VAT in the price
                                              ** show the VAT right below all fees and no indication that it is included
                                              * When market choose to not show any details of taxes
                                              ** VAT shall not be show

                                              h2. *Condition of Satisfaction:*

                                              * If remote config ShowSummaryInGrossPrice = true then the subtotal including the taxes are shown as a gross price
                                              * If remote config ShowSummaryInGrossPrice = false then show the subtotal excluding the taxes and fees
                                              * If remote config hideSummaryTaxes = true then don’t show separated taxes (only applies in the GROSS market)
                                              * If remote config hideSummaryTaxes = false show the separated taxes only if ShowSummaryInGrossPrice = true

                                              h2. *Value for Market/User:*

                                              * Clearer to the user because the pricing structure follows what’s expected for their market
